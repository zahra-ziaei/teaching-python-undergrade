        "There are many ways to solve this problem, but you can derive a general-purpose formula as follows: Each time you apply a convolution or max-pooling operation, the receptive field grows along a given spatial dimension according to the number of new activations seen in the convolution/pooling window. A convolution or pooling of size $k$ will reveal $k - 1$ *new* (i.e. not including the activation itself) activations from the previous layer. Assuming that the stride is not longer than the kernel size (which is the case in all of the questions here), each time you stride by a factor of $s$ you increase the number of visible activations by a factor of $s$. This leads to the following general-purpose recursion relation for the receptive field $r_l$ at layer $l$:\n",
